ResearchKit wrapper for Kinvey

The kinvey-researchkit package can be used to develop [ResearchKit](http://researchkit.org/) applications on the Kinvey platform. It wraps the [Kinvey iOS SDK](devcenter.kinvey.com/ios-v3.0) with classes that allow easy mapping of ResearchKit objects to a Kinvey backend.

Please refer to the Kinvey [DevCenter](http://devcenter.kinvey.com/) for documentation on using Kinvey.
